Researchers investigate parameters such as CO uptake at different pressures, temperature dependencies, and the MOF's stability during adsorption-desorption cycles. Additionally, studies may explore the influence of factors like MOF morphology, functionalization, and guest-host interactions on CO adsorption behavior. Overall, these experiments aim to elucidate the fundamental properties of CO adsorption on HKUST-1, providing valuable information for various applications such as gas storage, separation, and catalysis.\n",
