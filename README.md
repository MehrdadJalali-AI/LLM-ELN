## Main Components

- **LLM_ELN.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook is the central file where the integration of LLMs with ELNs is implemented and demonstrated.
- **LLM_MaterialsScience.ipynb**: Demonstrates examples of how LLMs can be utilized in the field of materials science to predict material properties, summarize research, and generate novel material compositions.
- **Evaluation_LLM_ELN.ipynb**: Contains the empirical evaluations conducted to assess the practical impact of LLMs on the research processes within materials science.
- **Plots_LLM_ELN.ipynb**: Provides visualizations and plots that illustrate the findings from the use of LLMs in materials science.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project, titled _ELN Sample Files_, is located in the 'database' folder. It includes various electronic lab notebook entries that are processed and analyzed by the LLMs.

## Installation and Setup

To run the notebooks, ensure you have Jupyter installed on your machine. Dependencies can be installed via pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Running the Notebooks

Open the Jupyter Notebooks in the following order to understand and interact with the functionalities developed:

1. **LLM_MaterialsScience.ipynb** - Start here to see basic examples of LLM applications in materials science.
2. **LLM_ELN.ipynb** - Proceed to detailed integrations with ELNs.
3. **Evaluation_LLM_ELN.ipynb** - Review the evaluation metrics and results.
4. **Plots_LLM_ELN.ipynb** - Visualize the impact and outcomes.
